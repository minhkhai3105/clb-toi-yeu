      Chelsea go down with 10 mins remaining, Drogba scores. Bayern get a pen in
      extra time, Cech saves. Bayern are ahead in the shootout, Cech saves x2. I
      remember when Drogba got the equaliser I just shouted his name as hard as
      I could for a long, long time. I was at uni in the States at the time and
      the water polo team had watched the semis and the final with me and my
      United supporting mate. A lot of football fans were made that day. Mostly
      Chelsea.

      Probably the most important game in Bayern's recent history. This started
      an attitude and a movement in the team where you do not stop until it's
      over. We also got in Mandzukic who was an massive upgrade from Gomez in my
      opinion - a real big game player and did everything he could for the team
      - and got in Martinez as well. Next season was just pure dominance.
