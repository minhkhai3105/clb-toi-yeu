        It was an epic moment. Difficult to explain if you weren’t a fan at the
        time, but I’ll try: Chelsea were massive underdogs. Over the two matches
        they were getting absolutely bombarded left and right by Barça (one of the
        best teams ever) but still by some miracle holding on to the advantage
        they had accumulated. In that match specifically it was 10v11. Everyone
        was waiting for the moment Barça were finally going to break through, but
        then in the final minutes there’s a sudden opening, Chelsea sees the
        chance for a counter attack.</br> Torres goes the length of the field, dribbles
        the goalkeeper, and deposits the ball in the net to seal the deal.
        Moreover, Torres had been extremely underwhelming for Chelsea up to that
        point, and that goal reminded the world of the Torres of old. It was a
        very impactful moment at the time, as a neutral it stayed with me to this
        day.</p>
